# Introduction
Using the U.S. Veterans Suicides dataset from Kaggle, the overall goal was to determine if Vet Sucidies could be predicted.
# Cleaning
Cleaning methods took 7 csv files removed unwanted columns, filled in NaN's and rename the columns to creat a cleaned version of that year.  Taking all the cleaned csv's they were combined and dropped any dupilcated columns that were the same then created a combined_cleaned_csv.
# Data
Using different techiques the goal was to make the reader able to follow the project with visuals. There are bar graphs, histograms, scatterplots that help illustrate the data.
The training models used where  ANOVA model, Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor and a 10-fold cross-validation.
# Results
The results show that the data doesn't allow the probelm to be answered with out having of factors to help predict if they will rise.
# Conclusion and Future work
The conclusion is that while all suicides rise and can be predicted vet suicides require more research on factors such as PTSD, Stress (emotional, financial, or work)
